This is a simple Machine Learning app that predicts whether a Spigot plugin is Free or Premium based on the amount of days it has been out, number of downloads, rating, and amount of ratings.

In my testing, it is pretty good at correctly labeling Premium plugins as Premium, but only okay at predicting Free plugins as Free. This is likely due to it only have 14 plugins worth of training data.
